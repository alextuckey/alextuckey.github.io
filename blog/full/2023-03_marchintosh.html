Below that is text in the Chicago font with the MARCHintosh hashtag."></a>			<br>            <p>Back in October 2022, I found a fairly good deal on a fully recapped Macintosh LC III for just under Â£90 on eBay; so I decided to take the plunge and bid on it, not expecting anything to happen. Surprisingly enough, I won the bid! The seller mentioned in the description that they originally brought it as fully recapped from a different seller, but I think had trouble getting a particular SCSI hard drive emulator to work... or something like that?</p>            <a href="images/IMG_4557.JPG"><img src="images/thumb/IMG_4557.JPG" alt="Closeup of the logic board on the LC III, which has had its old electrolytic capacitors replaced with tantalum capcitors.

I got an Apple Desktop Bus Mouse II a few weeks after getting the machine, but I didn't get a keyboard until just last week Friday (an AppleDesign Keyboard for those curious). Luckily as an alternative option, devices like the <a href="https://www.bigmessowires.com/usb-wombat/">ADB Wombat</a> exist which allow you to use a USB keyboard and mouse over ADB (or the other way round), if you can't find a good deal on the older ADB peripherals.</p>            <a href="images/DSC01731.JPG"><img src="images/thumb/DSC01731.JPG" alt="Three different DB15 to VGA adapters placed on a desk. From left to right; the first one is a custom made one, with both connectors seperated at different ends on a short cable. Then there's a Lindy adapter, which is more compact with both connectors together (DB15 on one end and VGA on the other) and there's a Lindy branding sticker added to the adapter itself. Finally, the one the right is unbranded with a similar compact all-in-one design, but includes a set of ten dipswitches for configuring the video mode you want to use."></a>            <br>            <span class="caption"><font size="-1"><i>The two DB15 adapters I got that didn't work with the one that did (3rd one on right)</i></font></span>			<p><font size="-1">Other image sizes: <a href="images/800/DSC01731.JPG">800px</a> <a href="images/1024/DSC01731.JPG">1024px</a> <a href="images/1440/DSC01731.JPG">1440px</font></a></p>            <p>And then there's the monitor adapters! I was already aware that many early Macintoshes can be quite picky with DB15 adapters, as I think they may output a different video mode regular PC monitors can't accept. I ended up going through two different DB15 to VGA adapters before finally getting one that worked with dip-switches on it. I also did come across some problems where the machine either didn't turn on at all or wouldn't chime, much like what the seller mentioned. Reconnecting the power supply seemed to fix that issue (maybe it wasn't grounded properly? Idk). </p>            <br>            <h2><i><a name="pastexp">Past experience with 68K Macs</a></i></h2>            <p>As of right now, this LC III is the only working 68K Mac I have in my collection. I actually used to have the Performa version of this (the Performa 450) with the later case design similar to the LC/Performa 475. It was one of the first few computers in my collection, which I got from a family member. Unfortunately at the time, I didn't really have the knowledge and tools (e.g. blank floppy disks) to get software onto it. As a result, I ended up letting my parents throw it out, which I still really regret to this day. :( </p>            <table class="multipleimg" border="0" width="620" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="0">              <tr>                <td>                <a href="images/DSC00312.JPG"><img src="images/thumb/DSC00312.JPG" alt="A Macintosh Peforma 450 with the newer style case design displayed on a clothing drawer with the Performa Plus displayed paired on top of it.

It probably may need a recap, which I currently don't have the skills/confidence to do myself. I'll go into more detail about this laptop when I eventually work on the 'Stuff' section of this site, but I would really love to get that PowerBook working someday, as it's a really unique series of small sub-notebooks (and I really like small laptops/desktops too). </p>            <a href="images/DSC03505.JPG"><img src="images/thumb_large/DSC03505_T.JPG" alt="PowerBook Duo 280c placed on a garden decking board during a summer late evening, with various smaller devices also placed around it.

Unlike the Performa (which was still in a fairly stock configuration) this one is kitted out with the 68882 co-processor installed, along with an additional 8 MB RAM (to go with the 4 MB onboard) and more VRAM as well. It does still have the original 80 MB Quantum ProDrive ELS hard drive installed and does still work! I'm definitely planning on getting one of the SCSI drive emulators (BlueSCSI, PiSCSI or both) at some point, which will make transferring files to it a lot easier. I've been using just floppy disks to get software and files over, using Mac OS 9 on my iMac G4 (which I'm also writing this article on) with an external USB floppy drive. </p>            <img src="images/thumb/LCIII_about.gif" alt="Screenshot of the About this Mac dialog taken on the LC III. It shows that it's running System Software B1-7.5, with 12 MB of RAM installed and 10 MB free in the system. Behind that, a couple of finder windows are open.

Luckily, System 7 can be used for the most part with only a mouse, along with the Key Caps application to input text when needed. Though this won't work in all cases; games like Malestrom (which was included on the LC III I got) require keyboard input and some applications can hide the menu bar when inputting text, meaning you couldn't copy and paste from Key Caps. </p>            <p>Other than those SCSI solutions, I would also like to try and get networking working on this as well. I'd imagine finding a PDS Ethernet card would be quite difficult (and maybe expensive), but thankfully there are other solutions out there. The one I'd be most interested in using would be the SCSI Ethernet emulation with the PiSCSI, but I think there are also some modern LocalTalk to Ethernet adapters you could use also. Regardless, I've definitely been having a lot of fun using this LC III and I'm excited to tinker with it more for sure :D</p>            <a href="images/PXL_20230224_194423583.jpg"><img src="images/thumb/PXL_20230224_194423583.jpg" alt="LC III running the Snooper 2.0 diagnostic utility on System 7.5.
