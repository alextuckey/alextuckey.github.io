I've wanted to try this particular camera for years, after first hearing about it from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Techmoan">Techmoan</a>'s older videos. these days, camcorders aren't really that common in the consumer market, being mostly taken over by the use of smartphones. Even though smartphones can record much higher quality video compared to them in most cases, nothing beats using a dedicated camcorder (or even still camera) like this in my opinion. it can encourage you more to take video/photos, as that's what they are designed for. there's an excellent video from a couple of years ago about <a href="https://youtu.be/tbAhS2ax_gQ">a particular Sony Bloggie</a> (a short-lived pocket camera line that smartphones also made obsolete) by Green Ham Gaming, who explains that concept in more detail than I probably could here.</p>            <h2><i><a name="sensorycomic">Sensory: Life on the Spectrum Comic</a></i></h2>            <a href="img/DSC04357.JPG"><img src="img/thumb/DSC04357.JPG" alt="The physical copy for Sensory: Life on the Spectrum being held up in my hand towards the camera, showing the front cover"></a>            <p><font size="-1">Other image sizes: <a href="img/800/DSC04357.JPG">800px</a> <a href="img/1024/DSC04357.JPG">1024px</a> <a href="img/1440/DSC04357.JPG">1440px</a></font></p>            <p>I also want to give a mention to this really great comic anthology that <a href="https://schnumn.com/">Bex Ollerton</a> put together called <a href="https://schnumn.com/sensory">'Sensory: Life on the Spectrum'</a>.

It happened at probably the worst time as well, during a holiday to Jamaica with my family. my theory on what caused it is that the waterproof doors covering the ports and battery were probably worn out. Thinking about it, I should have gotten replacements for those beforehand, as I think some sand/salt water particles probably got into the hinges and wherever else from using it in sea water many times.</p>            <a href="img/DSC04347.JPG"><img src="img/thumb/DSC04347.JPG" alt="Comparison of my older GoPro Hero 5 Black and Hero 10 Black cameras side-by-side.

I didn't go for current Hero 11 model because, other than maybe the aspect ratio flexibility with the 8:7 sensor, there wasn't much difference I found in the features it offered compared to the 10. and of course, it's a bit cheaper as well. So yeah, I'm perfectly happy with the 10!!</p>            <h2><i><a name="otherthings">Other things</a></i></h2>            <a href="img/2023010219391500-splat3.jpg"><img src="img/thumb/2023010219391500-splat3.jpg" alt="In-game screenshot of Splatoon 3 taken in the game's lobby area.

It's definitely very cool, so I'll be playing it more at some point. And finally, a projector!!
