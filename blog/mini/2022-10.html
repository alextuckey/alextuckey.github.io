it's just basically for unstructured rambling about stuff I've been doing and want to share, etc.</p>			<p>during the last few weeks, i started 2nd year of uni, doing work on this website (before getting it up online) and doing a lot of testing on this Avermedia capture card i brought recently!</p>			<p>it's a Avermedia Live streamer cap 4K and it's a (sort of) upgrade over the Elgato HD60 (original) that i've had since 2016. that Elgato has worked pretty well for recording, but (because of the USB 2.0 interface and the in-built encoder chip) it introduces quite a bit of latency when previewing the image in software. this, of course, would be a bit of a problem for streaming, meaning you would have to add an offset to your other audio/video sources if you want everything to sync up. i personally haven't streamed myself in quite a few years, but it is something i'm thinking about doing again (every once in a while).</p>			<a href="img/vlcsnap-2022-10-01-19h15m52s513.jpg"><img src="img/thumb/vlcsnap-2022-10-01-19h15m52s513.jpg" alt="Picture showing the Elgato HD60 and Avermedia capture card side by side"></a>			<p>being a more "cam-link" style capture card, this only has the one HDMI input and no passthrough, unlike my elgato HD60; which means I have to use a separate splitter if I'm using it with game consoles. the low latency preview does mean you could play from just the preview if you wanted, but it may not be particularly ideal.</p>			<p>i've been mainly testing it with my nintendo switch, as well as my Atlona AT-Line-Pro5 scaler (which I use for doing VGA capture from old computers, among some other things). from that, I've found that the capture card also supports recording at common computer resolutions (e.g. 800x600, 1024x768, 1280x800) and not just standard TV resolutions (e.g. 720p, 1080p), which is really awesome!! although, it definitely won't work well if your switching resolutions natively with the capture card (recording in OBS), requiring you to re-activate the source. it took me quite a while to figure out the right configuration to use with it, but it seems to work pretty well from what I've tried so far.</p>			<img src="img/thumb/x41t_winxp.jpg" alt="VGA capture screenshot from a ThinkPad X41T running Windows XP Tablet PC edition, set to the Royale theme, with the Start menu open">			<br>			<span class="caption"><font size="-1"><i>VGA capture screenshot from my ThinkPad X41 Tablet</i></font></span>			<p><font size="-1">View in: <a href="img/x41t_winxp.jpg">JPG</a> <a href="img/x41t_winxp.png">PNG</a></font></p>			<img src="img/thumb/tmsunrise.jpg" alt="VGA capture screenshot of TrackMania Sunrise, showing the profile/car customisation screen">			<br>			<span class="caption"><font size="-1"><i>VGA capture screenshot of TrackMania Sunrise, from my HP Compaq dc5700 Microtower</i></font></span>			<p><font size="-1">View in: <a href="img/tmsunrise.jpg">JPG</a> <a href="img/tmsunrise.png">PNG</a></font></p>			<p>one of the other things I did recently was test my OQO model 01 UMPC. i got this back in late 2020 and initially couldn't get it working. i figured out about a year later that something is wrong with the connections in the main display assembly, as I managed to randomly turn it on when fiddling with the display. </p>			<a href="img/IMG_4357.JPG"><img src="img/thumb/IMG_4357.jpg" alt="OQO Model 01 UMPC doing some multitasking in Windows XP, showing MS Paint, Windows Media Player 10 and the Task Manager open.

I do also have a Tungsten T, but I currently don't have a power adapter for it.</p>			<a href="img/DSC04203.jpeg"><img src="img/thumb/DSC04203.jpg" alt="Palm Vx and Tungsten E2 both shown together.
