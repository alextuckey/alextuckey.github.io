I tried writing this post last month as a standalone blog post, but I struggled to figure out how to write it (if you get what I mean, lmao).</p>            <br>            <h2><i><a name="siteupdates">Website Updates</a></i></h2>            <a href="../../gallery/images/img001.html"><img src="../../gallery/images/thumb/VirtualBox_Windows2000_11_02_2023_15_43_10.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a Windows 2000 virtual machine with the IconArt software open. The window displays an earlier version of the 32 by 32 favicon for this website, enlarged with a pixel grid, with some options for editing tools on the left and colour pallette on the right. The favicon features a background of a Tetris light and some warm fairy lights to the side, with a blue LED illuminating the scene. Some text in a yellow pixel-style font appears in front which reads &quot;OR456&quot;. Above the editor is where other sizes for the icon are displayed. Here, there's that 32 by 32 version along with a smaller 16 by 16 one as well, displayed in the original size. The smaller 16 by 16 version is similar to the other one, but only displays the text &quot;456&quot;"></a>            <p>earlier this year in February, I made a favicon for this website!! I wanted to have one some time earlier, but I struggled trying to figure out a design for it (particularly something that works at a 16x16 or 32x32 resolution). the one I made isn't perfect, but I think it works well enough. I ended up making two designs for those resolutions in GIMP and then used a (somewhat) obscure freeware program called <a href="https://archive.org/details/tucows_293034_IconArt">&quot;IconArt&quot;</a> on Windows 2000 to make a .ico file from them. Honestly, I could have done that just fine in GIMP as well (which I found out afterwards), but it was still fun trying out some older software for that regardless.</p>            <p>as for other website related stuff, I finally started working on the Gallery section of the site this month. so far, I've added the images featured in this post in the gallery section; I just need to figure out how I want the main page for it to be organised. Along with that, I've continued doing research on different web hosting solutions to host this site with (as I've mentioned a few times here). If any of you reading this have any good suggestions or tips for this, feel free to let me know :3</p>            <br>            <a href="../../gallery/images/img002.html"><img src="../../gallery/images/thumb/GOPR1699.JPG" alt="Filming setup I used for the bonus segment in the LC III video, showing an iMac G4 at the corner of a desk.

The file names used for the camera footage indicate that it is a ProRes 422 transcode, to help editing with this version of Final Cut."></a>            <p>as for making for the video itself, the process was quite a bit different compared to previous stuff I've done. since I originally wanted to try editing this one of my older Macs, I recorded all of the VGA capture footage in ProRes using QuickTime for more efficient editing (apart from the section with the iMac G4, which I just recorded with OBS on Linux). the problem I had here is that, as mentioned earlier, with me trying to finish this in a certain time frame and balancing uni work, I wasn't able to properly spend time planning what I wanted to use to edit the video and how. what I ended up doing was using editing software I'm already experienced with, which was Final Cut Pro X on my 2017 MacBook Pro. regardless, I'm happy with how the video turned out and hopefully I can do some other project like this where I use old video editing software in the future.</p>            <br>            <h2><i><a name="mobilelinux">Tinkering with Mobile Linux</a></i></h2>            <a href="../../gallery/images/img005.html"><img src="../../gallery/images/thumb/DSC04461_S.jpg" alt="Galaxy S3 running postmarketOS v22.12.2 with its custom config of the Xfce desktop environment.

I would recommend checking out <a href="https://h00.neocities.org/posts/dalt">this blog post</a> by h00, which talks a bit more about Matrix and some of the other common alternatives to Discord, if you want to learn more about this. </p>            <p>but yeah, with the recent stuff of Twitter and Reddit &quot;breaking down&quot; due to shitty controversial decisions, I wouldn't be surprised if Discord does something similar at some point down the line.</p>			<hr width="560">			<p><font size="-1"><i><a href="../index.html">back to blog page</a></i> | <i><a href="#miniblognav">jump to top</a></i></font></p>            </font>		</td>	</tr></table></div><hr width="630"><div align="center" class="footer"><img src="../../images/orangey456_button1.gif" alt="Orangey456 web button" width="88" height="31" border="0"><a href="https://msx.gay"><img src="../../buttons/gay.gif" alt="Made With Pride button" title="Button Credit: https://msx.gay" width="88" height="31" border="0"></a><a href="https://anlucas.neocities.org"><img src="../../buttons/viewedmonitor.gif" alt="Site Best Viewed With a Computer Monitor (web button)" title="Button Credit: https://anlucas.neocities.org/" width="97" height="31" border="0"></a><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220217060950/https://neo.b266.ca/"><img src="../../buttons/transnow2.gif" alt="Trans Rights Now!
