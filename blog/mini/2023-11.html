I've been back in uni again, but was unfortunately also ill for almost all of October, so I wasn't able to do a whole lot :(</p>            <p>regardless, I have been (very slowly) working on reworking this site a bit and implementing (some very basic) PHP to help make things like modifying the page layout a lot easier using <font face="monospace">include</font> functions, whilst still keeping the site compatible with older browsers. as I've mentioned a few times on here (lol), I definitely want to move to self-hosting this website very soon (probably with a VPS or something). I do have a couple of  hosting services in mind to use now and a domain name TLD as well.</p>            <p>So yeah, at this point I've nearly finished reworking this site in basic PHP and, when I do move this over from Github Pages to hosting it myself, I'll probably make a full blog post talking about the updates I've done a bit more.</p>            <br>            <br>            <a href="img/PXL_20230924_172135155.jpg"><img src="img/thumb/PXL_20230924_172135155.jpg" alt="Photo of the HP Omnibook 5700CT displaying it's BIOS setup screen, listing some general system information in three separate boxes.

I've had it for a few years, having got it from a car boot sale back in February 2020, but was never able to get it working since I didn't get it with a power adapter and couldn't find a universal one that worked. I randomly came across a listing for the original power adapter a few months ago on eBay, so I brought it. I was very happy to find that the computer turned on and works just fine for the most part!!</p>            <br>             <a href="img/vlcsnap-2023-09-27-00h05m51s345.jpg"><img src="img/thumb/vlcsnap-2023-09-27-00h05m51s345.jpg" alt="Picture of the Omnibook loaded into a DOS shell from it's original install of Windows 95.
