<body><h1 style="text-align: center;">Alex Test Site!!! wow</h1>Hi
there, this is a just a test site to see how well I can create a
webpage and all of that. I don't really know what else to write here,
so yeah lmao<br><br><a href="images/vlcsnap-2020-09-06-13h40m46s048.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 320px; height: 240px;" alt="Splash screen of a Sony Cybershot DSC-P7 directly captured from composite" src="images/vlcsnap-2020-09-06-13h40m46s048_T.gif"></a><br><br>As
you can see above, that is the composite output from a Sony DSC-P7
Cybershot camera. Unfortunately when I last tried to use it, the lens
assembly seemed to be faulty, meaning it doesn't seem to open at all :(
&nbsp;would be nice to get it working (somehow) in the future.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="images/vlcsnap-2020-09-06-13h44m11s001.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 320px; height: 240px;" alt="Closeup photo showing the top of the Cybershot camera itself, with the model number, power button and mode dial" src="images/vlcsnap-2020-09-06-13h44m11s001_T.gif"></a></span><br><br>But
yeah, I am using an application called KompoZer under Windows XP on a
HP Compaq dc5700 Microtower to make this page. This could be a good
option to use for making a Web 1.0 styled website, but I may try out
some other solutions to see what works best for me in this case.<br><br>Anyways, thanks for reading this! lol<br><br><br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Made by Alex T on 10th May 2021</span> &nbsp;<a title="Document made with KompoZer" href="http://kompozer.net/"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 80px; height: 15px;" alt="Document made with KompoZer" src="images/kompozer_80x15.png"></a></body></html>
